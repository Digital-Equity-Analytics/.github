## Hi there 👋

### 🙋‍♀️ What Digital Equity Association is about?

We are embedded in a community of like-minded specialists and organizations that understand the need for standards and good practices to “do no digital harm” whilst keeping up with the rapid speed of technological innovation and implementation. We recognize and build on an emerging consensus principally articulated in documents such as the [Principles for Identification ](https://id4d.worldbank.org/principles)(facilitated by the World Bank’s ID4D project), the [Signal Code of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative](https://signalcode.org/), the [Platform for Good Digital Identity](https://www.weforum.org/projects/digital-identity) (facilitated by the World Economic Forum), as well as the [Universal Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence](https://thepublicvoice.org/ai-universal-guidelines/) (Public Voice, October 2018).

### Our Mission

**We believe that the digital revolution should benefit all.** 

A sustainable and robust digital transformation must be anchored in systemic capacities that are supported by and achievable to the whole of society. Systemic capacities refer to the core elements that lie at the basis of all change like laws and regulation, infrastructure, and financial planning. These are to be applied to enable foundational dimensions like digital identities, trade of goods and services, and fair distribution of benefits.  

Equally, enabling opportunities must go hand in hand with understanding and avoiding risks like misuse of digital information, online hate and disinformation, identity fraud, circumvention of rules and regulations, and unethical behaviour.    

For everyone, the digital transformation must enable the enjoyment of all civil and political rights, access to services, engaging in all types of online transactions, and socio-economic inclusion in general.     

### Our Principles 

- **Inclusive**

Accessible to all, including especially disadvantaged and marginalised people and small businesses.

- **Universally trusted**

Recognised by authorities and institutions, individuals and businesses. 

- **Democratically governed**

Digital transformation is not a business model, but a rights-based concept requiring institutional mandates and accountability, legal and trust frameworks that are subject to legitimate governance, the rule of law, and independent oversight.

- **Equity Promoting**

Facilitate fair sharing of benefits derived from the digital transformation between all stakeholders, especially to individuals and the public.

- **Secure**

Facilitate secure digital transactions with effective and appropriate risk management, especially in the realm of cybersecurity.

- **Useable and self-managed**

Use of digital data empowers the individual and is an enabler for socio-economic inclusion. Every data subject should have agency over, and should be manager of, their own data.

- **Privacy Protecting**

Provide absolute protection of privacy, allowing citizens and consumers to maintain anonymity where appropriate, and limit the collection of personal data, especially political data, in accordance with current international best practices, at present as established in the EU’s GDPR.

- **Relevant**

Fulfil real needs and enable significant improvements over existing systems.

- **Affordable**

Minimize cost by harnessing existing infrastructure as well as promoting competition and innovation by enabling standards and regulations.
